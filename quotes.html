  <h1>Quotations which left some marks</h1>
       <!-- A paragraph -->
       <p class="text">“... remember we are all made of stardust.” - Carl Sagan</p>
       <p>To experience the infiniteness of the universe with respect to us, 
        watch  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g" target="_blank">pale blue dot.</a> </p>

       <p class="text">“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. 
         So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” - Steve Jobs</p>
       <p>One of the best motivational speeches I have ever heard was delivered by Steve Jobs during 2005 convocation at Standford university.
         Steve Jobs died in 2011, when I was in college. I still remember that day as in Anadabazar Patrika this whole speech was translated in Bengali and 
         I was thrilled to read it for the first time in life. Even till now, sometimes I listen to it to recharge my motivation:
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc" target="_blank">stay hungry, stay foolish.</a> </p>

       <p>I also find the echoes of the above quote in the life of the scientist Shuji Nakamura who was awarded Noble Prize in Physics 2014 
         “for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources”. 
         Here is a nice video explaining the challenges for making blue LED and how Nakamura able to achieve it through his resilience:
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF8d72mA41M&t=6s" target="_blank">Why it was almost impossible to make the blue LED?</a> </p></p>
